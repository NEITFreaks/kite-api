## Guide to proper git usage

- New Feature => New Branch => New PR when complete
    - Each new branch ( with exceptions for `dev` and `prod` ) have an expiration duration of ***Three Days*** from their creation
        - You are afforded **one** time extension equal to the length of the expiration duration of the branch.
        - if your task is *too big*, then break it up into smaller tasks or request help from another team member.
- Push all the time, commit everything. Don't wait till tomorrow

## Task chronolgy

  - Register task in [Asana](http://asana.com)
  - Work on it
  - Commit Message / PR Description should be similar, if not the same, as the Asana task title/description
  
  <small>
  Note that this does not mean that every commit message must be an Asana task title, because that would be a silly waste of time. Only major commits must have this attribute. Things like spelling errors and small fixes should be titled respectively according to their nature (i.e. "Fixed spelling error").
